# Designing Fault-Tolerant Ethernet Networks in Factories

This project simulates an industrial Ethernet network with redundancy and failure recovery using Python and Streamlit.

## Features
- Visualize real-time Ethernet topology.
- Simulate link failures.
- Detect connectivity status automatically.
- Demonstrates fault tolerance with redundant paths.

## Run the App
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run ui_app.py
